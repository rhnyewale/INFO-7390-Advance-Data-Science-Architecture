    "Science and engineering have seen amazing progress over the last few centuries. We are now able to launch a spacecraft from Earth and predict it will arrive on Mars at a certain time and location. However, it looks like not everything is as easy to predict as the trajectory of a spacecraft.\n",

    "Take tossing a coin, for instance — as ridiculous as it may sound, we're not able to predict with certainty whether the coin is going to land on heads or tails. And that's because a coin toss is a very complex phenomenon. The outcome depends on mutiple factors — the strength and the angle of the toss, the friction of the coin with air, the landing angle, the surface the coin lands on, etc.\n",

    "Although we can't tell beforehand the outcome of a coin toss, we'll learn in this course that we're able to at least estimate the probability (the chances) of a coin landing on heads or tails. This may sound like a limitation, and in a way it is, but estimating probabilities is an extremely powerful technique that can enable us to build non-trivial applications, including:\n",
