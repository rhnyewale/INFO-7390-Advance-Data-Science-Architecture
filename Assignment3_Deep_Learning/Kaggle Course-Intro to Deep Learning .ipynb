    "# What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "Some of the most impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have been in the field of deep learning. Natural language translation, image recognition, and game playing are all tasks where deep learning models have neared or even exceeded human-level performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is deep learning? **Deep learning** is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. This depth of computation is what has enabled deep learning models to disentangle the kinds of complex and hierarchical patterns found in the most challenging real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through their power and scalability **neural networks** have become the defining model of deep learning. Neural networks are composed of neurons, where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form."

    "\n",
    "The input is x. Its connection to the neuron has a **weight** which is w. Whenever a value flows through a connection, you multiply the value by the connection's weight. For the input x, what reaches the neuron is w * x. A neural network \"learns\" by modifying its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The b is a special kind of weight we call the **bias**. The bias doesn't have any input data associated with it; instead, we put a 1 in the diagram so that the value that reaches the neuron is just b (since 1 * b = b). The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The y is the value the neuron ultimately outputs. To get the output, the neuron sums up all the values it receives through its connections. This neuron's activation is **y = w * x + b**, or as a formula  **y=wx+b** .\n",

Training a model with 'sugars' (grams of sugars per serving) as input and 'calories' (calories per serving) as output, we might find the bias is b=90 and the weight is w=2.5. We could estimate the calorie content of a cereal with 5 grams of sugar per serving like this:\n",

We can just add more input connections to the neuron, one for each additional feature. To find the output, we would multiply each input to its connection weight and then add them all together.\n",
