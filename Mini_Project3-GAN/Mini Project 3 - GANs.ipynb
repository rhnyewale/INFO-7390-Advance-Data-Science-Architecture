    "\n",
    "In order to generate synthetic images, we make use of two neural networks during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A generator that accepts an input vector of randomly generated noise and produces an output “imitation” image that looks similar, if not identical, to the authentic image\n",
    "2. A discriminator or adversary that attempts to determine if a given image is an “authentic” or “fake”\n",

    "By training these networks at the same time, one giving feedback to the other, we can learn to generate synthetic images."
